#FrozenLake - Reinforcement Learning
Aims to solve FrozenLake with various RL-Techniques at a beginner level.

##Deterministic
- [ ] Q-Tables
- [ ] Deep Q Learning(no fixed Targets, no Memory, no Double-Q)
- [ ] Policy Gradient

The remaining Techniques won't be tested in this simple case.

##Stochastic
To be researched in depth.
Current guess is estimating a distribution of actions instead of reward-values.
Maybe Policy Gradients or N-Step Q-Learning could solve it?
